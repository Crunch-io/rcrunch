#' Work with CrunchCubes, MultitableResults, and TabBookResults
#'
#' These functions provide an interface like [base::margin.table()]
#' and [base::prop.table()] for the CrunchCube object. CrunchCubes contain
#' richer metadata than standard R `array` objects, and they also conceal
#' certain complexity in the data structures from the user. In particular,
#' multiple-response variables are generally represented as single dimensions
#' in result tables, but in the actual data, they may comprise two dimensions.
#' These methods understand the subtleties in the Crunch data types and
#' correctly compute margins and percentages off of them.
#'
#' These functions also generalize to MultitableResults and TabBookResults,
#' which are returned from a [tabBook()] request. When called on one of those
#' objects, they effectively apply over each CrunchCube contained in them.
#'
#' `bases` is an additional method for CrunchCubes. When making weighted
#' requests, `bases` allows you to access the unweighted counts for every
#' cell in the resulting table (array). The `bases` function takes a
#' "margin" argument to work like `margin.table`, or with `margin=0`
#' gives all cell counts.
#'
#' @param x a CrunchCube
#' @param margin index, or vector of indices to generate margin for. See
#' [base::prop.table()]. `bases()` accepts `0` as an additional valid
#' value for `margin`, which yields the unweighted counts for the
#' query.
#' @param digits For `round`, the number of decimal places to round to. See
#' [base::round()]
#'
#' @return When called on CrunchCubes, these functions return an `array`.
#' Calling prop.table on
#' a MultitableResult returns a list of prop.tables of the CrunchCubes it
#' contains. Likewise, prop.table on a TabBookResult returns a list of lists of
#' prop.tables.
