#' Create a fork of a dataset
#'
#' Forking a dataset makes a copy of the data that is linked by Crunch's version
#' control system to the original dataset. When you make edits to a fork, users
#' of the original dataset do not see the changes.
#'
#' A common strategy for revising a dataset that has been shared with others is
#' to fork it,
#' make changes to the fork, and then merge those changes back into the original
#' dataset.
#' This workflow allows you to edit a dataset and review changes before
#' publishing them, so that you don't accidentally send your clients
#' incorrect data. For more on this workflow, see
#' `vignette("fork-and-merge", package = "crunch")`.
#'
#' @param dataset The `CrunchDataset` to fork
#' @param name character name to give the fork. If omitted, one will be provided
#' for you
#' @param draft logical: Should the dataset be a draft, visible only to
#' those with edit permissions? Default is `FALSE`.
#' @param ... Additional dataset metadata to provide to the fork
#' @return The new fork, a `CrunchDataset`.
#' @seealso [mergeFork()]

#' Merge changes to a dataset from a fork
#'
#' Crunch datasets include information about the dataset's revision history.
#' This function takes the changes made on a dataset fork and adds them to the
#' revision history of the parent dataset, like a merge of branches in a
#' version control system.
#'
#' All modifications of a dataset record actions in its revision history. For
#' example, if you add a variable to the dataset, that action is recorded. The
#' sum of these records is a dataset's revision history, and it is possible
#' to merge in the revision history of a dataset that has been forked.
#'
#' This function is most often used in conjunction with [forkDataset()] to
#' create a copy of a dataset, make some changes to that copy, and then merge
#' the changes back into the original dataset. For more on this workflow, see
#' `vignette("fork-and-merge", package = "crunch")`.
#'
#' @param dataset The `CrunchDataset` to merge to
#' @param fork The `CrunchDataset`, which must be a fork from `dataset`, that is
#' to be merged in.
#' @param autorollback logical If the merge fails, should `dataset` be restored
#' to its state prior to the merge, or should it be left in its partially
#' merged state for debugging and manual fixing? Default is `TRUE`.
#' @param force logical Attempt to push through merge conflicts by dropping all
#' changes to `dataset` that occurred after `fork` diverged from and take only
#' the changes from `fork`? Default is `FALSE`. You should only use `force=TRUE`
#' after first attempting and failing to merge without forcing.
#' @return `dataset` with changes from `fork` merged to it.
