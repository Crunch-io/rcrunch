Description: The Crunch.io service (http://crunch.io/) provides a cloud-based
    data store and analytic engine, as well as an intuitive web interface.

    datasets from within R. Importantly, this allows technical researchers to
    collaborate naturally with team members, managers, and clients who prefer a
