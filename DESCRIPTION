Title: Crunch.io Data Tools
Description: The Crunch.io service (http://crunch.io/) provides a cloud-based
    data store and analytic engine, as well as an intuitive web interface. 
    Using this package, analysts can interact with and manipulate Crunch
    datasets from within R. Importantly, this allows technical researchers to
    collaborate naturally with team members, managers, and clients who prefer a
    point-and-click interface.
