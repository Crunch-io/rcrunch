I believe I have fixed the arm64-macos issue found by the automatic checks, but have been unable to confirm (I believe the problem was actually related to time zones).

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.1.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.1.0
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Downstream dependencies
No regressions were found.
