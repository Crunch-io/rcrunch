\description{
Crunch objects usually keep themselves in sync with the server when you
manipulate them, but sometimes they can drift. Maybe someone else has
modified the dataset you're working on, or maybe
you have modified a variable outside of the context of its dataset.
refresh() allows you to get back in sync.
