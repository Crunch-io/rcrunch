\description{
Crunch allows you to stream data to a dataset. Streaming data is useful for
datasets which have frequent updates (see the
\href{https://crunch.io/api/reference/#post-/datasets/-dataset_id-/stream/}{Crunch API documentation}
for more information). Crunch automatically appends streamed data
periodically; however, if you would like to trigger appending pending
streamed data to a dataset, you can call \code{appendStream()}.
