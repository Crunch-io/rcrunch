\title{Crunch.io: instant, visual, collaborative data analysis}
\description{
\href{http://crunch.io/}{Crunch.io} provides a cloud-based data store and
analytic engine. It has a \href{https://beta.crunch.io/}{web client} for
interactive data exploration and visualization. The crunch package for R
allows analysts to interact with and manipulate Crunch datasets from within
R. Importantly, this allows technical researchers to collaborate naturally
with team members, managers, and clients who prefer a point-and-click
interface: because all connect to the same dataset in the cloud, there is no
need to email files back and forth continually to share results.
