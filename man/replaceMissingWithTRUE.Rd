\description{
When subsetting, missingness stands in for selecting all of the elements of that
dimension. This gets tricky when you are selecting n dimensions and so need to
capture the dimensions with \code{...}.  This function checks if an element of a list
is missing and replaces that element with \code{TRUE} in order to handle this case.
