\usage{
appendDataset(dataset1, dataset2, autorollback = TRUE,
  cleanup = autorollback)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset1}{a CrunchDataset}

\item{dataset2}{another CrunchDataset, or possibly a data.frame. If
\code{dataset2} is not a Crunch dataset, it will be uploaded as a new
dataset before appending.}

\item{autorollback}{logical: If the append fails, revert the dataset back
to its state before attempting to append? Default is \code{TRUE}, and you
probably won't want to change that.}

\item{cleanup}{Deprecated in favor of \code{autorollback}. See also
\code{\link{cleanseBatches}}.}
}
\value{
A CrunchDataset with \code{dataset2} appended to \code{dataset1}
