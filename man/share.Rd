\usage{
share(dataset, email, edit = FALSE, notify = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{a CrunchDataset}

\item{email}{character: email address(es) of the users with whom to share
the dataset. If there is no Crunch user associated with an email, an
invitation will be sent.}

\item{edit}{logical: should the specified user be given edit privileges on
the dataset? Default is \code{FALSE}. \code{edit} can be a single value or,
if inviting multiple users, a vector of logical values of equal length of
the number of emails given. Currently, only one user may have
\code{edit=TRUE} at any given time, so there may not be more than one
\code{TRUE} value in the logical vector.}

\item{notify}{logical: should users who are getting new privileges on this
dataset be sent an email informing them of this fact? Default is
\code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
